## Ortwin ? ðŸ™„

The name of this bot means Point friend. Ortwin is a slack bot that is there to help everyone out, being a friend and single point of access for cheering everyone in workspace. Ortwin can do various things like responding with GIFs or reacting to messages ðŸ˜Š

Things Ortwin can do

- When someone says "morgan" or "morgen", Ortwin will reply in a thread with Morgan Freeman GIF ðŸ¤ª
- When someone says "good morning" or "good bye", then respond with emoji reaction.
- When you direct message or mention Ortwin and
  - Say "programming quote", he will respond with a programming quote.
  - Say "xkcd", he will respond with latest xkcd comic.
  - Say "weather", he will respond with the weather for the city (it is hard coded to Berlin, but you can pass a different one if you want to).
  - Say "hi", he will introduce himself.
  - Say "happy birthday", he will wish you.
  - Say "faq", he will list out the links.
  - Say "lunchtime", he will react with a food emoji (sometimes, to avoid spamming the channel)
