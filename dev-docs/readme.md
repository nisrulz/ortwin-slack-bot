# Install Botkit

```

# Create your bot
```

```
When asked for messaging platform, select `slack`

Now,

[Create a Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps/new) (if you don't already have one). Give it  a nice name and select the workspace you would like it to be added to:

![Create a Slack app](img/create_slack_app.png)

Once created, you will see the below screen. Select **Bots**:

![Select Bots](img/select_bots.png)

Once done, you need to navigate to **Basic Information** item in the sidebar:

![Goto Basic Info](img/goto_basic_info.png)

Scroll down to **Display Information** block and update the display info for the bot: 

![Setup display info](img/setup_display_info.png)

Scroll up to **App Credentials** block and copy the **Signing Secret** to be used later in some place: 

![Copy Client Signing Secret](img/app_cred.png)

Next you need to navigate to **OAuth & Permissions** item in the sidebar and scroll down to **Scopes**, add an OAuth Scope i.e `channel:history`:

![Add Scope](img/add_scope.png)

Once added, you can scroll up to **OAuth Tokens & Redirect URLs** and hit the **Install App to Workspace** button:

![Install App to Workspace](img/install_app.png)

Hit **Allow** in the next screen:

![All install](img/all_install.png)

Once you are back to the settings page, copy the **Bot User OAuth Access Token** to be used later in some place: 

![Bot Token](img/bot_token.png)

Awesome ðŸŽ‰ Now you have both the `CLIENT_SIGNING_SECRET` and `BOT_TOKEN` with you. You also need `GIPHY_API_KEY` for this bot, about which you can [read here](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint/)

At this point you should go ahead and deploy to Heroku, filling in the details when asked during app creation

![Deploy to Heroku](img/deploy_to_heroku.png)

You will have access to a publically available url. For example here, we will use `https://example.heroku.com/`

Once ready, you need to navigate to **OAuth & Permissions** item in the sidebar and add this url to **Redirect URLs**:

![Redirect URL](img/redirect_url.png)

Next, you need to navigate to **Event Subscriptions** item in the sidebar, enable events and add your url with `/api/messages` appended to it. i.e `https://example.heroku.com/api/messages` :

![Setup Event Subs](img/setup_event_subs.png)

> The URL will be validated so that the bot is up or not.

Next, you need to navigate to **Interactivity & Shortcuts** item in the sidebar, enable Interactivity and add your url with `/api/messages` appended to it. i.e `https://example.heroku.com/api/messages` to both **Request URL** and **Options Load URL**:

![Setup Interactivity](img/setup_interactivity.png)

That should be all. Now code your bot and deploy to heroku. You should be able to interact with it inside Slack.
